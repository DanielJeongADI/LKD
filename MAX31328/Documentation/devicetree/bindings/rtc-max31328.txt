* Maxim MAX31328 Real Time Clock

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "maxim,max31328".
- reg: I2C address for chip.

Optional property:
- #clock-cells: Should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume. Following indices are allowed:
    - 0: square-wave output on the SQW pin
    - 1: square-wave output on the 32kHz pin

- interrupts: rtc alarm/event interrupt. When this property is selected,
  clock on the SQW pin cannot be used.

Example:

max31328: max31328@68 {
	compatible = "maxim,max31328";
	reg = <0x68>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};
